## Forward+ & Clustering Deferred Shading Summary

A brief description of your project and the specific features you implemented

## Performance Analysis

### Naive

Concise overview and explanation of the feature.
Detailed performance improvement analysis of adding the feature.
What is the best case scenario for your performance improvement? What is the worst? Explain briefly.
Are there tradeoffs to this performance feature? Explain briefly.
How do parameters (such as number of lights, number of tiles, etc.) affect performance? Show data with graphs.
Show timing in milliseconds, not FPS.
Show debug views when possible.
If the debug view correlates with performance, explain how.
