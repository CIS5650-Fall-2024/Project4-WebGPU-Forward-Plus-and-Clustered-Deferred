### (TODO: Your README)

*DO NOT* leave the README to the last minute! It is a crucial part of the
project, and we will not be able to grade you without a good README.

This assignment has a considerable amount of performance analysis compared
to implementation work. Complete the implementation early to leave time!

## Features
- Naive Renderer
  In naive forward rendering, the light contribution calculation needs to be performed fn * ln times, where fn is the number of fragments and ln is the number of lights.
