### Performance Analysis

1. Is one faster?
   Clustered Deferred shading consistently outperforms both Naive and Forward+ methods, especially with increasing numbers of lights. The gap becomes more pronounced with larger light counts:
   At 5000 lights, Forward+ takes 593 ms, while Clustered Deferred takes only 175 ms.
   Forward+ shows improvements over the Naive approach but doesnâ€™t scale as efficiently as Clustered Deferred, especially with higher light counts.

2. Workload differences:
   Forward+ is faster with smaller light counts but struggles to scale due to its per-tile light list generation.
   Clustered Deferred shading handles higher numbers of lights better since it clusters both geometry and lights, reducing redundant lighting calculations.
