### (TODO: Your README)

*DO NOT* leave the README to the last minute! It is a crucial part of the
project, and we will not be able to grade you without a good README.

This assignment has a considerable amount of performance analysis compared
to implementation work. Complete the implementation early to leave time!

## Performance Analysis

```
Compare your implementations of Forward+ and Clustered Deferred shading and analyze their differences.
Is one of them faster?
Is one of them better at certain types of workloads?
What are the benefits and tradeoffs of using one over the other?
For any differences in performance, briefly explain what may be causing the difference.
```
